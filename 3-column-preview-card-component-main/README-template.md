### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- Flexbox




### What I learned


I learned to make a website responsive to viewport changes by using @media
query. 

 Secondly learned to import fonts from google.

 Lastly I learned to center a div both verticaly and horizontaly.


### Continued development

I did this project without mobile first approach.In my next project I want to do it mobile first because desktop first approach caused some issues to me.I also want to focus on positioning a div. I'm not really comfortable with flexbox and grids so i had to practice it. For positioning the card i used transform attribute but i dont know how it is used.I copy pasted that part so i had to learn that. The other thing is i couldn't change border radiuses when i tried to change it in the container div. Because of that i handled it by changing the border radiuses of the inner divs individualy. I think that wasn't a healthy solution so i want to make more research about it and make it less hardcoded.




## Acknowledgments

I got help in the slack community about how to change divs flex direction by viewports width and height

These are the Slack nicknames of the people who helped me to make my solution:
